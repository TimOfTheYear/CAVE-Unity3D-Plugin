INSTALLATION:

- Just drag the CAVE folder into an existing Unity3D project.

SETUP:

  -3D CAVE Camera
  
    1. Drop a CAVE Camera prefab into the scene.

    2. Treat this CAVE Camera like you would any other camera object.

    3. Only change the child cameras if you need to edit Skyboxes/GUI Layers/etc.

    4. Finally, drop a 3D Viewer prefab into the scene somewhere out of the way.

  -CAVE Multi-Screen Networking

    1. Create a new scene to act as your menu.

    2. Add a NetworkManagerScript somewhere in your scene.

    3. Create a new script that inherits from NetworkDisplay.

    4. Overload the ClientCamInit() method and add code to destroy your scripts that handle user input, then call base.ClientCamInit().

    5. Add one of these new NetworkDisplay scripts to the scene and then add a reference too it in the editor to the NetworkManagerScript.

    6. Fill out the other necessary attributes for NetworkManagerScript:
          - SceneToLoad: String name of the scene you want to load that is equipped with a CAVE Camera.
          - IP: This should be the ip of the screen acting as the server (Usually the center screen).
          - Port: Generally, you can just keep this at 25000 and be fine.
          - Connections: Max number of connections to server, make sure this is at least as large as the number of screens in your CAVE setup.
          - Use NAT: This should pretty much always be disabled, since there most likely isn't a router between your CAVE computers.
          - Use Master Server: Again, this should be pretty much always be disabled since you are probably on a LAN.
          - Server Name & Server Description: These are only used for registering with the Master Server, so you can probably ignore them.
